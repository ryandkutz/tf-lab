# root.hcl — Shared configuration inherited by every unit in this repo.
#
# HOW INHERITANCE WORKS:
#   Every unit's terragrunt.hcl has `include "root" { path = find_in_parent_folders("root.hcl") }`.
#   That causes Terragrunt to merge this file's config into the unit before running.
#   So the provider and backend below apply to every unit automatically — you never
#   repeat them.
#
# HOW HIERARCHICAL VARS WORK:
#   Terragrunt searches upward through the directory tree for environment.hcl and
#   region.hcl. Because of the layout:
#
#     <env>/environment.hcl       <- environment name, subscription ID
#     <env>/<region>/region.hcl   <- Azure region
#     <env>/<region>/<stack>/...  <- units live here
#
#   a unit in dev/eastus/core-services/ automatically picks up dev's environment.hcl
#   and eastus's region.hcl. Add a new environment by creating a folder — no changes
#   needed here.

locals {
  environment_config = read_terragrunt_config(find_in_parent_folders("environment.hcl"))
  region_config      = read_terragrunt_config(find_in_parent_folders("region.hcl"))

  environment_name = local.environment_config.locals.environment_name
  subscription_id  = local.environment_config.locals.subscription_id
  azure_region     = local.region_config.locals.azure_region

  # Backend storage config — from environment variables.
  #
  # Why no defaults for storage account?
  #   - Storage account names must be globally unique in Azure; no generated name is safe.
  #   - Dev subscriptions rotate every few hours, so the backend changes with them.
  #
  # For dev: run scripts/bootstrap-dev-backend.sh on each new sandbox.
  #          It creates backend storage in the predefined RG and prints the vars to export.
  # For prod: set these once in your CI/CD secrets or shell profile.
  #
  # Required:
  #   TF_BACKEND_STORAGE_ACCOUNT — globally unique Azure storage account name
  #
  # Optional (have sensible defaults):
  #   TF_BACKEND_RESOURCE_GROUP  — defaults to rg-tfstate-<env>
  #                                 (dev overrides this to the predefined sandbox RG)
